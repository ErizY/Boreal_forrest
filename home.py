<p>Fire behaviour is changing worldwide. In general terms, landscape fires are occurring more often and becoming more severe. Being directly related to the planet's heating by human-caused climate change, we asked what this means for the planet's most inhospitable, enormous and life-giving forest - the Boreal/Taiga. The world's largest land biome makes its way around the entire top of Earth as a giant ring shape. Therefore it connects people from Europe, Asia and North America. It is rich with animal and plant diversity and, due to the harsh winters, is sparsely populated by people.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This tool provides an open-source exploration of the Boreal & Taiga to scan about and consider our relationship with the forest, which many of us benefit from in terms of air quality yet seldom see in our daily lives. We hope with this tool, you will be able to connect with it.</p>
