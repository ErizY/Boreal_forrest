<p>Hello and welcome. We have made this open-source exploration of the Boreal & Taiga to develop an interest in how fire lives on the landscape and with people. This was created to spread awareness of the ongoing issues caused by the global heating crisis.
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We discovered that despite the forest's size and vital role in climate stability, few people know this. We felt that it would be great to bring some attention to fire activity and began writing code to enable free public exploration.
</p>
<p>Consider this vast region of life-giving ultimate beauty. Up north lays 11.5% of the Earth's surface, working away naturally all year around while we sleep. It makes me think of our lungs, yet it is also much like our heart and blood, moving and circulating without any thought or direction from us. When we consider the variety of unseen inter-relationships from air quality to commercial wood and oil in our daily lives, we hope with this tool, you will be able to connect with the source.</p>
<p>In the background of this exploration into an earthly wonderland is the seriousness of accelerated human-caused climate change. The IPCC Chair stated in June 2022, "We are not on track to achieve a climate-resilient sustainable world.‚Äù There is much work to do, and we hope this project can positively impact essential social and political change.</p>

<h4 style="text-align: center; font-family:Times;color:#24851A;">5 Facts About The Boreal/Taiga Forest</h4>

<p>- The forest zone consists of 8 countries which include: Canada, China, Finland, Japan, Russia, Norway, Sweden and the United States. It also covers some costal areas of Iceland, areas of Northern Kazakhstan, Estonia and the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- Canada has 28% of the worlds Boreal/Taiga Zone which conists of 552 million hectares.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- The Forest covers 17 million square kilometres (6.6 million square miles) or 11.5% of the earths land.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- The largest areas of the forest are in Canada and Russia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>- The fire season typically lasts from May to October with peaks of activity between July and August. Approximately 2 million hectares of the Canadian forest region burns at this time.</p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to acknowledge all historical, present and future peoples of the Boreal/Taiga. To recognise the value of critical infrastructures such as air, fire, water, plants, and animals, which are our greatest allies in balancing human-caused climate change. This critical infrastructure predates invasive human laws and technology with its ensuing resource exploitation and climate change. That much of this land is Unceded Territory. We ask for your support to progress this exploration under cultural guidance because we aim to create an inclusive platform where Indigenous stakeholders' knowledge is expressed without translation by the Centre of Ecological Philosophy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The project is possible because of data from NASA and the European Space Agency. We would like to thank Thomas Lanning for his expertise in working with big data sets, Mukesh Bhatt for his guidance with space technology, law and cultural awareness and Jessica Waal for walking through the design and development process.</p>
